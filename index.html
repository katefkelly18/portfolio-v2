              <p>Greetings! Thank you for visiting my first portfolio page. My name is Kate Kelly and I am in the part-time course at Epicodus. This entire coding experience has all been very new to me, however with each passing day I learn so many new and interesting things that any fears I had in the beginning of this course have turned into only excitement and joy. If you have any questions for me after reviewing my work shared below, feel free to email me <a href="mailto:katefkelly18@gmail.com" class="important">here</a>!</p>
              <p>You might ask why someone who has zero experience with coding would want to start a coding course? Well, my career thus far has been mainly hospitality based. I have been <strong>so fortunate</strong> to work in beautiful hotels and social clubs working with guests and gaining experience across the industry. With that said, after 10 years in the hospitality industry I was ready for a change. Currently I work with hundreds of software engineers and Product Managers at <a href="https://www.vacasa.com/">Vacasa</a>, a vacation rental management company based in Portland. My colleagues have been a huge inspiration to me during this journey and I have been able to consult many of them along the way! Also, not only is the demand for software engineers incredibly high, as a woman I am hopeful that my experiences will encourage other women to dive into the male-dominated software engineering world to help create more diversity.</p>

In the picture adjacent you will see my immediate family and my husband's family at our wedding last year in Dublin, Ireland, where my husband was born and raised. From left to right, here are their names and relation to me:</p>

            <p>The other <span style="color:red">loves</span> of my life are my cats, Abbey (L) and Quin(R), shown here. <em>Supposedly</em> they are sister cats (they look very similar so I think that they are) and were rescued in the Portland area in laste 2016. We adopted them in February of 2017 (on Valentines Day!) and they bring my husband and I so much joy. Not to mention, cats are incredibly easy to take care of which works well for our lifestyle. My sisters and I love to rescue and foster cats and kittens in the area; there are so many that need homes, we do our best to help when we can!</p>
